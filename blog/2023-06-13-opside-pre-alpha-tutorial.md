## Today we'll talk about Opside Glaxe campaignüëá üëá

[Opside](https://opside.network/) is a decentralized ZK-RaaS (ZKRollup-as-a-Service) network featuring zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mining, whose innovative approach combines proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW). Enable Web3 developers to quickly generate zkEVM application chains with just a click. And, through its three-tier architecture design and zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, it improves the performance, security, and scalability of decentralized applications (DApps). It makes a number of system-level optimizations to zk-rollups and also introduces the concept of local Rollup. So based on this architecture, L2 gains asset diversity from bridge connectivity and five extendibility from Rollup, providing a friendlier environment for various DApps.

To sum up, asset diversity and infinite scalability are the advantages that distinguish Opside from other blockchains.

The Opside mission lasted for a total of 3 months , and the characteristics of its mission can be summarized by **"Perseverance"**.

### The Second plate: Opside DiveIn!
The event link is https://galxe.com/Opside/campaign/GCoNhUYxq8

<img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/25.webp" width="300" /> <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/26.webp" width="300" />

Next, we will start the formal task tutorial.

#### 1. The first part is to use the official bridge to cross the Goerli ETH test coin 
* At present, it is difficult to get the test coin, you can go to the website you trust to buy a little~ remember to use the kind of contract interaction~ If you need it, we will also sort out some territorial waters collection websites and purchase websites we use later

* Open the FoxWallet app, click on the third "Discover" section at the bottom of the page. We can see "Opside" special banner in this page, Click in to go to `Galxe * Opside` Page, click `Opside DiveIn!`, enter the task page and we can see our first 3 points task.
    ![](/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/28.webp)
    ![](/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/29.webp)
    * Click the event `Detail` link
        ![](/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/30.webp)
    * Click the `Call-to-Action` link to jump to the Opside-Bridge page.  
        <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/31.webp" width="300" />
    * And connect your wallet(FoxWallet is compatible with Metamask, so just click `Metamask` here) . Then click `Confirm`, switch the network to `Goerli Testnet`.  Then cross the Goerli ETH test coin, click `Confirm`, the first task is complete!
        <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/32.webp" width="300" />

* Then we go to pick up our Opside test coin IDE.
    * Step 1: Join the official Opside Discord `https://discord.gg/opsidezk`
    * Step 2: Enter the `for-general-users` channel  
        ![](/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/37.webp)
    * Step 3: @Opside Faucet, enter your wallet address, send a message and you will receive your TestIDE
        ![](/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/38.webp)

#### 2. Next, look at the second plate. 
To trade on Opside for 30 days, you can get 50 Points after 60 days. Then if you complete 30/60/100 transactions on the test network, you can get 10/20/30 Points respectively. Perseverance prevails! After all, this project lasts for 3 months.

There are very few dapps at present. You can go to the official Bridge every day to conduct cross-chain operation transactions, and you can also interact on BLOCKNG. 

* BLOCKNG
    * Enter the URL [https://opside.testnet.blockng.money/](https://opside.testnet.blockng.money/) in the search box on the FoxWallet `Discover` page.<br/>  
         <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/42.webp" width="300" />
    * Go to `Swap` tab, select a pair, enter the number of `IDE`, and click `Swap`.<br/>  
        <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/43.webp" width="300" />
    * Go to `LIQUIDITY` tab, and click `Add Liquidity` as indicated by the red arrow in the image below. In the last round of Swap, we have obtained a certain amount of `LAW`. Here we directly click `MAX`, and the other side will automatically pair a certain number of `IDE` and click `Supply`. After that, the pop-up window will appear to confirm the approval, you all click `Confirm`, and the `LP` will be formed!<br/>
        <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/44.webp" width="300" /> <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/45.webp" width="300" /> 

* Bridge your assets via the public zkEVM bridge<br/>
  Follow the instructions of the red arrow below with FoxWallet.   
  There are 6 IDE as gas required here, and there are 10 you can get every day. We can assign IDE to different tasks according to the interaction situation.

  <img src="/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/52.webp" width="400" />


*Attention! The above demos are all operated using the FoxWallet mobile App, which is very convenient. You can use the FoxWallet App to interact when you are bored outside and play Tiktok every day. People spend time, and you use time to create money!*

### Third plate: Opside's dApp Evolution
Opside's dApp Evolution is an interactive section with OKX Wallet, BK Wallet, and FoxWallet.  
The event link is [https://galxe.com/Opside/campaign/GCcUXUX8S9](https://galxe.com/Opside/campaign/GCcUXUX8S9).  
These three tasks are very similar. They all import the wallet address that they connected to Galxe into BitKeep, FoxWallet, and OKX wallet respectively.

![](/img/blog/opside-pre-alpha-tutorial/54.webp)

1. First download BitKeep wallet, add it to the extension program, import your testnet account connected to Galxe.

2. The second is to download FoxWallet (Official link: https://foxwallet.com/download )
Import the account connected to Galxe into FoxWallet. Then add the testnet.

3. The third is to click on the Galxe task link to download OKX wallet, browse their various websites, and forward their tweets~
(Click the link in the task, and the Twitter page will automatically jump out) Click the Retweet button below, and it's ok~

### 
Finally, the project time is **2023/05/25 00:00 - 2023/08/23 00:00 GMT+08:00**

The duration is quite long, and the main points' task is the second section. It is recommended that everyone take the time to trade it every day. After all, the official clearly confirmed airdrop rewards~ I hope everyone can act quickly and not be lazy.
All the wealth and opportunities are through your daily accumulation and persistence to lay a solid foundation, and then inadvertently quietly come, if there is no bear market foreshadowing and accumulation, even if the bull market even if the wealth is not necessarily able to guard live.

A man's success depends on his work, even if you miss an opportunity or lose some money. I hope everyone will remember to keep a small piece of sobriety to reflect on themselves while being eroded by emotions. For me, there are no setbacks experienced in vain, no efforts in vain, everyone is the protagonist of their own life world, merit and reward, wealth and joy will come quietly one day.
Finally, Cecilia wishes everyone good health and wealth!
