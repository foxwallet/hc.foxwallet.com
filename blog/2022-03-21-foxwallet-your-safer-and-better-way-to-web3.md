## FoxWallet - Your Safer and Better Way to Web3
Since its launch on 15th November 2021, FoxWallet has received extensive support from the community, with over 10,000 downloads of the App and 40,000+ users across platforms. Over the past 4 months, our team have been upgrading and improving the product and collecting users' feedback. We are committed to making it a professional Web 3 tool that's safe, reliable, versatile, and user-friendly.  

### Safer and more professional user experience
In the Web3 era, wallets are not just tools for storing, managing, or transferring cryptocurrencies, but portals to a digital ecosystem. Users can directly visit and log in to other Web3 products via a wallet to quickly access various blockchain applications. Therefore, safety has become increasingly important for any wallet, laying the foundation for developing crypto wallets. 
  
**Then, why is FoxWallet safe and reliable?**
  
First, from a design perspective, FoxWallet follows general standards such as BIP-32, SLIP-0044, and BIP-44. While supporting multiple chains and several sets of mnemonics and compatibility with other wallets regarding mnemonics and addresses, it allows users to use one set of seed phrases for several accounts. The address derivation principle is mnemonics => different derived private keys based on the chain and account number => different public keys and addresses computed with different private keys. Under this logic, every address is relatively independent. 
  
Second, as a decentralized wallet, the mnemonics and private keys of FoxWallet are stored locally, instead of being uploaded to the server, which has enhanced the security of the wallet. Users control their assets and keep their private keys and seed phrases, lowering the risk of theft. In addition, FoxWallet is the only audited mobile wallet that the Filecoin Foundation recommends. 

For Defi users, FoxWallet is undoubtedly a better option. In the Defi world, there are numerous cryptocurrencies, intertwined with complicated rules, making the security of Defi protocols shaky. Users have to make frequent asset transfers and token swaps. With multi-chain and multi-address support, while ensuring relative independence of each address, FoxWallet meets all the needs of Defi players. Users can use separate addresses for different Defi products, effectively insulating risks. While they can participate more efficiently, they enjoy security assurance. Moreover, FoxWallet allows users to access popular Defi products directly, providing a smooth user experience. It optimizes the procedure, lowers the threshold for Defi, and makes it much easier and less time-consuming for users.  

### More Functions for Users
Now FoxWallet is a crypto wallet which provide Ethereum and Filecoin transfer/receive support. And the Web3 browser in FoxWallet supports integration with Ethereum so users can login some DApps directly. 
  
Wallet is the gate to Web3 world, FoxWallet aims to serve as a better choice for the entrance to the Web3 world. So FoxWallet will support BNB Chain, Polygon, Evmos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Aurora, Aelo, Celo, Cronos, ETC, Fantom, Gnosis, HECO, Moonriver, OKExChain, Optimism in the next few weeks.
  
Besides those basic functions, one of the main features of FoxWallet is fully supporting Filecoin ecosystem. Users can keep up-to-date with on-chain data and track the latest info of miners. At the same time, FoxWallet has enabled the FIL Faulty Sector Monitor and the FIL Balance Tracking Functions, making it easier for Filecoin miners to manage and track the state of nodes.
