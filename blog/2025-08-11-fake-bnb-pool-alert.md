### Scam Characteristics and Identification Tips

#### Impersonating Official Accounts
Scammers have meticulously fabricated names and links such as "Binance BNB Pool" and "Binance Online Customer Service," leveraging Binance's brand credibility to gain trust. Please note that Binance has never officially launched such "deposit ETH and get BNB back" arbitrage programs.

#### False "High Yield" Promises
The scam promises "automatic returns of 5%-20% within 30 minutes" and "1 ETH can be exchanged for 4-10 BNB." This type of "risk-free, high returns" far exceeding market norms is a hallmark of a classic Ponzi scheme and should not be trusted.

#### Suspicious Contract Address
The payment address provided by the scammer, `0xa353316F320b2aF5a8fD2f0bCa0429655A000000`, has been flagged as a scam by multiple parties. Any funds sent to this address will be permanently lost and cannot be recovered.
