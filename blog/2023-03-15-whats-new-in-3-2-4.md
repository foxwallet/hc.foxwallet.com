### New Network Filecoin EVM
The Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) is a runtime environment for smart contracts (also called actors) on the Filecoin network. FVM brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy.    

You can find "Filecoin EVM" under "Me" -> "Networks" and select to enable it. With Filecoin EVM, you will experience similar functionalities as in the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing you to send tokens and interact with dApps.
