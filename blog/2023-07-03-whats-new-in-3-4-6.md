We are pleased to announce the release of FoxWallet 3.4.6 update. Please find below the details of this update.

### Iron Fish UTXO Consolidator
Iron Fish utilizes the UTXO model, and when a transaction involves too many UTXOs, it takes a long time to request the UTXO list from the backend. Additionally, the signing time for transfers also increases.   

To address this issue, we have introduced the UTXO Merger tool, which allows you to merge multiple small UTXOs into a single large UTXO.

### Show Scam Warning on Transaction Details Page
Many fraudsters send phishing airdrops to potential targets, leading users to visit their phishing websites. In this update, we have implemented a risk check on the transaction details page. When a risk is detected, FoxWallet will provide a prominent warning.   

If you encounter such a risk warning, please refrain from visiting their website or adding their tokens.
