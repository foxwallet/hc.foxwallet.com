[Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/) is the world's first decentralized open-source platform supporting private and programmable applications. It is dedicated to building a modular and compliant zero-knowledge privacy application platform, which provides unlimited computational space and absolute privacy for users and application developers using decentralized systems and zero-knowledge proofs.  

We are pleased to announce that **FoxWallet is the world's first mobile decentralized wallet for Aleo**. Users can perform Aleo private transfers within FoxWallet, and the entire process is protected by local private keys to ensure fund security and privacy.

**At the same time, FoxWallet is also the world's first wallet that supports public transfers, record join and split for Aleo.**

### BRC20
BRC20 is an experimental format standard for issuing homogeneous Tokens on the Bitcoin network. It was published by [@domodata](https://twitter.com/domodata) on March 8, 2023 based on the [Ordinal Protocol](https://hc.foxwallet.com/docs/bitcoin/ordinals) created. Similar to the ERC20 standard of Ethereum, it stipulates the name, circulation, transfer and other functions of Token issued on Ethereum.    

FoxWallet already fully supports BRC20 tokens, you can directly use the Bitcoin receiving address in FoxWallet to receive your BRC20, and sending is also very simple and convenient.
