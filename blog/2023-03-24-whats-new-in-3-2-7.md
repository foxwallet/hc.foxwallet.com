### New Network zkSync Era
[zkSync Era](https://zksync.io/) is a Layer-2 protocol that scales Ethereum with cutting-edge ZK tech. Their mission is not only to merely increase Ethereum's throughput, but to fully preserve its foundational values – freedom, self-sovereignty, decentralization – at scale.

You can find "zkSync Era" under "Me" -> "Networks" and select to enable it.

### New Network Polygon zkEVM Testnet
[Polygon zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm) is a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution that uses cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to offer validity and quick finality to off-chain transaction computation, also known as a ZK-Rollup.

The ZK-Rollup executes smart contracts transparently, by publishing zero-knowledge validity proofs, while maintaining opcode compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
