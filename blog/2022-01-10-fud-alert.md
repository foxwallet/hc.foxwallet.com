## FUD Alert

Dear all,

Recently, FoxWallet has received feedback from many users about receiving scam text messages or emails asking them to transfer assets to fraud platforms for exchanging coins in the name of “FoxWallet”. 

FoxWallet promises that our platform ensures the safety of all users’ assets. Users can transfer assets in FoxWallet as usual. FoxWallet will never send any text messages asking users to withdraw assets or make transfers in private.

Please be cautious with your assets. Once transferred to another address, your assets will belong to that address. Do not click any link in suspicious text messages or emails. Do not take any calls from unknown IDs. Never disclose your personal account information, text message verification code or other important information to strangers or third parties. Make sure to protect your personal information. 

Sincerely,

FoxWallet
