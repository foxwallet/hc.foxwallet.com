Zero transfer scam refers to a type of fraudulent activity that specifically targets users on the Tron and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. The scam typically involves the fraudulent transfer of 0 tokens from a user's wallet using the `TransferFrom` function. The purpose of this scam is to create a fake transaction history that appears in the user's wallet, leading them to mistakenly use the scammer's address and potentially risking their money.  

The attacker intentionally uses an address that resembles the victim's address by having the same first and last few characters. By doing so, they aim to deceive the target into believing they are interacting with a familiar address. Consequently, the target may unknowingly send funds to the attacker's wallet instead of the intended recipient.  

The zero transfer scam relies on trickery and deception, exploiting users' trust and familiarity with wallet transactions to manipulate them into making unintended transfers or interacting with fraudulent addresses. Vigilance and careful verification of transaction details are essential to avoid falling victim to such scams.  

### What should I do ?
- Donâ€™t worry if you have `Zero Token Transfers` in your transaction history. These transfers do not affect the security of your assets.
- Exercise caution and verify the address: Before executing any transactions, always double-check the address you are sending crypto to. Be wary of fraudulent addresses that may resemble the intended recipient's address. Don't copy address from history record.
- Utilize the [Address Book](https://hc.foxwallet.com/docs/basic/address-book) feature: Use the address book feature available in your wallet to prevent sending funds to incorrect addresses. This feature helps mitigate the risk of accidentally sending crypto to scam addresses.
- Stay vigilant and informed: If you come across any suspicious transfers or transactions, take the time to calmly investigate the matter. Stay updated with the latest news and information to be aware of potential scam techniques.
