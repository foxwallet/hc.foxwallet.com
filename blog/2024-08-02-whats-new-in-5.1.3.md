### Integrated Tron Network
[TRON](https://tron.network/) is an open-source public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. TRON is compatible with Ethereum, which means that you can migrate smart contracts on Ethereum to TRON directly or with minor modifications. TRON relies on a unique consensus mechanism to realize the high TPS of the TRON network that is far beyond Ethereum, bringing developers a good experience of faster transactions.  

Tron TRC20 tokens will be supported in next update.

### Added ZChains Network
[ZChains](https://www.zchains.com/) is an interoperable L1 network, driven by its ecosystem and focused on delivering experience-based services. It is a modular and extensible framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, sidechains, and general scaling solutions. The primary function of ZChains is to bootstrap new blockchain networks while ensuring full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and transactions. ZChains utilizes the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus mechanism, supported in a Proof of Stake (PoS) format.
