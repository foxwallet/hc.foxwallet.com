### New Networks

#### Bahamut Mainnet
[Bahamut](https://www.bahamut.io/) is an EVM-based blockchain, which means that it is built on the same technical framework as Ethereum. This allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on Bahamut using the same programming languages and tools as they would on Ethereum. In addition, Bahamut uses PoSA as its consensus mechanism. 
By using EVM and PoSA, Bahamut aims to provide a fast, scalable, and secure blockchain network that can support a range of decentralized applications and use cases.

#### Tuna Testnet
[Tuna Chain](https://tunachain.io/) is conceptualised to synergise Bitcoin's unparalleled security with Ethereum's multifaceted EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality. While Bitcoin stands as the most trusted cryptocurrency, its capability for complex smart contracts and advanced applications remains limited. Tuna Chain ambitiously endeavors to bridge this gap, integrating EVM compatibility into Bitcoin’s L2 framework and thus expanding the realm of possibilities for Bitcoin’s application and utility.
