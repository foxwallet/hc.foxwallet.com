## In this issue, we present the tutorial for Taiko Alpha-3 Incentivized Testnet ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
![](/img/blog/taiko-alpha3-tutorial/1.webp)

Taiko is a decentralized, Ethereum-compatible ZK-EVM and general-purpose ZK-Rollup. Its purpose is to allow developers and users of dApps developed for Ethereum L1 to seamlessly utilize Taiko without any modifications. As a result, dApps can be easily deployed to L2, inheriting Ethereum's security while generating lower transaction fees compared to L1.

According to the latest reports, Taiko raised a total of $22 million in its seed round, led by HongShan on September 1,and on June 8th, it received a $12 million investment led by Generative Ventures.

**On June 7th, Taiko launched the Alpha-3 incentivized testnet, which focuses on the decentralized and Ethereum-compatible ZK-EVM component. However, it's important to note that this incentivized testnet is specifically for Proposers and Provers (the first and second batches of early contributors). You can check the following link to see if you are on the list (also for individuals holding TTKO tokens):**
