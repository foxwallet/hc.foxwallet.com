### New Networks

#### Mantle
Mantle Network is a technology stack for scaling Ethereum, and we strive to be EVM-compatible while doing so. Being EVM-compatible means all the contracts and tools that work on Ethereum also work on Mantle Network with minimal modifications. Users can experiment with exciting web3 apps, and developers can deploy smart contracts in an efficient, low-fee environment.  

#### Taiko Eldfell L3 Testnet
Eldfell L3 (alpha-4) is Taiko's fourth testnet, featuring inception layers and a new staking-based prover economics. The testnet aims to test deploying Taiko on Taiko as an L3 inception layer and experimenting with the new staking-based proving design. Inception layers provide flexibility in designing the rollup space, allowing Taiko to be deployed as L2, L3, or even further layers like L4s. The testnet also introduces a staking-based prover economics model, where provers are selected from a pool based on stake, expected reward, and capacity. The pool is limited to 32 provers, with a minimum capacity per prover of 128.

#### Shardeum Sphinx Dapp 1.X
Shardeum Sphinx Dapp is a parallel testnet introduced by Shardeum to accelerate the onboarding of new dapps within their ecosystem. It allows developers and users to deploy and test their contracts and dapps independently, ensuring uninterrupted progress while the team works on stabilizing the main testnet, Sphinx Validator.

### Warning against zero-transfer scams
Zero transfer scam refers to a type of fraudulent activity that specifically targets users on the Tron and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. The scam typically involves the fraudulent transfer of 0 tokens from a user's wallet using the `TransferFrom` function. The purpose of this scam is to create a fake transaction history that appears in the user's wallet, leading them to mistakenly use the scammer's address and potentially risking their money.
