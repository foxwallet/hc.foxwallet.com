We are pleased to announce the release of FoxWallet 3.4.5 update. Please find below the details of this update.
<!--truncate-->
### Support for dApp interaction on Bitcoin
Starting from this version, FoxWallet's built-in browser supports interaction with dApps on Bitcoin, such as online payments and decentralized exchanges. Developers can read the technical integration documentation: [Bitcoin Provider](https://hc.foxwallet.com/docs/developer/webview/bitcoin-provider) for more information.


### Added network Opside Pre-Alpha Testnet
The Opside Pre-alpha incentive testnet was officially launched on May 24th, Beijing time, and is expected to run for three months. During this period, all ecosystem roles (regular users, node validators, miners, and developers) can contribute their efforts and earn points as rewards. The points earned during the testnet can be exchanged for mainnet tokens after the Opside mainnet goes live. After the current Pre-alpha testnet ends, an Alpha testnet will be launched in Q3, which will implement ZK-Rollup proof nodes' decentralization, a complete PoW mining mechanism, cross-rollup communication mechanism, etc. Ultimately, the mainnet is expected to go live in the first half of next year.

You can find `Opside Pre-Alpha Testnet` under "Me" -> "Networks" -> "Testnets" and select to enable it. 

### Transfer page optimization
We have made some important improvements to the transfer page.

#### Token amount converting
We added a conversion button in the amount input box on the transfer page. When you click this button, you can enter the fiat currency amount, and FoxWallet will automatically convert it into the corresponding token amount based on the latest exchange rate.

#### Support for scanning QR from local albums
We added an entry to the local album in the scan page. You can select the QR code image saved on your phone for scanning.

#### Better display of Gas Price information
We display the Gas Price information in the Gas setting component, which makes it easier for users to see the current Gas parameter settings.
