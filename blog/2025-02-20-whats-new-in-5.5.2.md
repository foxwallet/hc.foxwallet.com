### Added New Networks

#### UniFi Testnet
[UniFi](https://www.puffer.fi/unifi) is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) Rollup solution designed to scale Ethereum while addressing liquidity fragmentation. Unlike traditional Rollups that rely on centralized sequencers, UniFi pioneers a "Validator-Based Rollup" model where transaction sequencing is performed directly by Ethereum L1 validators. This decentralized approach ensures trustless and neutral transaction ordering while redistributing transaction fees back to Ethereum validators, promoting Ethereum’s long-term sustainability. UniFi also offers ultra-fast transaction speeds (100ms pre-confirmation), instant withdrawals to L1, and an EVM-compatible development environment, making it a scalable, efficient, and developer-friendly scaling solution. 

#### Plume Mainnet
[Plume](https://www.plumenetwork.xyz/) is a modular Layer 2 blockchain tailored for real-world assets (RWAs), integrating asset tokenization and compliance at the protocol level. Plume simplifies the deployment of RWA projects while creating a blockchain ecosystem that enables cross-investment across various tokenized assets. Through DeFi applications, Plume enhances RWA composability, providing increased liquidity and access to high-quality investors for tokenized projects.  

#### CAGA Mainnet
[The CAGA Network](https://www.cagacrypto.com/) offers a fast, secure, and scalable decentralized blockchain designed to support safe and efficient transactions while addressing the scalability challenges that hinder the mass adoption of blockchain technology. It is built to create a seamless environment for users and developers to build blockchain-based solutions and improve user experience.  

#### Lumoz Mainnet
[Lumoz](https://lumoz.org/) is a next-generation modular AI computing network that provides scalable computational power and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) solutions for AI and blockchain ecosystems. Designed to address the high costs and inefficiencies of ZK computing, Lumoz supports Rollup networks and a range of advanced technologies, enhancing efficiency and accessibility in AI and blockchain development.
