### Added batch inscribe tool
Recently, with inscriptions gaining momentum in the Bitcoin market, this trend has extended into the Ethereum ecosystem. To meet this growing demand, FoxWallet has introduced a groundbreaking tool â€“ 'Batch Inscribe'. This tool is compatible with all EVM chains. Users simply need to input the inscription text or hexadecimal data, along with the desired quantity of inscribed transactions, and we will automatically generate and send the transactions. Representing the pinnacle of user-friendly, powerful, and secure batch inscription tools currently available, this feature can be found within the 'More Tools' section of the FoxWallet asset page.
