- Fixed Filecoin transactions getting stuck due to low Gas.
- Corrected token added status display on transaction details page.

- Resolved issues with transaction list refresh and loading.
- Added support for claiming Qtum Testnet test coins.
- Fixed copied URLs not updating after webpage redirection.
