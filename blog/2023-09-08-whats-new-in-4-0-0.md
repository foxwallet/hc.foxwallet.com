### Support for Aleo dApp Interactions
FoxWallet is the world's first mobile decentralized wallet that supports Aleo. In this version, FoxWallet supports dApp interactions on the Aleo network. As a developer, you can create your own dApp and perform operations such as information retrieval, transfers, and contract calls through FoxWallet.

### DeFi Portfolio
We have added a new feature for DeFi asset information. Now, under the "DeFi" section on the wallet page, you can view aggregated data from nearly 1,700 DeFi protocols on this address, supporting more than twenty networks such as Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and more. You can also click to view detailed data such as staking, borrowing, liquidity, and more for each project.

### New Networks

#### Qtum
We now fully support [Qtum](https://qtum.org/), the world's first smart contract platform based on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. Qtum combines the advantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum and adopts a blockchain design based on the UTXO model. It not only supports the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), but also offers security similar to Bitcoin. This new support allows you to manage your assets more diversely on FoxWallet.

#### Goshen Testnet
[Goshen Network](https://goshen.network/) is an Optimistic rollup protocol that extends transaction throughput with lower gas costs while maintaining the decentralization and security of the Ethereum (base chain). The protocol uses RISC-V machines to support on-chain computation and enables fraud-state trimming by simply identifying a "step" in the RISC-V-Chain program when faced with challenges.

### Enhanced Security
- Added address security scanning tool provided by [De.Fi](https://de.fi/).
