We are pleased to announce the release of FoxWallet 3.4.4 update. Please find below the details of this update.

### Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs supported

#### What are Bitcoin Ordinals?
Bitcoin Ordinals were introduced in January 2023 as a method of generating Bitcoin NFTs by attaching information to individual satoshis. 

Each Bitcoin is broken into 100,000,000 units called satoshis (or sats). The Ordinals protocol is a system for numbering satoshis, giving each satoshi a serial number and tracking them across transactions. Simply put, ordinals allow users to make individual satoshis unique by attaching extra data to them. This process is known as `inscription`.

Ordinals are inscribed directly onto individual satoshis, which are then included in blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals reside fully on the blockchain and do not require a sidechain or separate token. In this sense, ordinal inscriptions inherit the simplicity, immutability, security, and durability of Bitcoin itself. 

#### Ordinals NFTs on FoxWallet 
You can receive and view your Ordinals NFTs under the "NFT" tab.
