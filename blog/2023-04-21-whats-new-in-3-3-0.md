We are pleased to announce the release of FoxWallet 3.3.0 update. Please find below the details of this update.

### Add New Networks

#### Bitcoin
[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) was the first cryptocurrency created and is now the most traded and well-known. It was first launched in January 2009 by a computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose actual identity has never been verified. 

You can find `Bitcoin` under "Me" -> "Networks" and select to enable it. 

#### EOS EVM
[EOS EVM](https://eosnetwork.com/eos-evm/) bridges the EOS ecosystem to the Ethereum ecosystem by allowing developers to deploy a wide array of Solidity-based smart contracts and innovative dApps on the EOS Network to make use of its world class performance and low gas fees. 

Developers can utilize Ethereumâ€™s battle-tested open source code, tooling, libraries and SDKs while leveraging the superior performance of EOS to create a multichain Web3 experience.

#### Godwoken
[Godwoken](https://godwoken.com/) is an L2 network running on the [Nervos blockchain](https://www.nervos.org/). It is an Ethereum-compatible layer inside of an optimistic rollup, which allows for low cost, high speed transactions with a familiar user and developer experience.

#### Opside
[Opside](https://opside.network/) is a decentralized ZK-RaaS network of the form "Base chains <- Opside chain <- Rollups.".
It has the advantages of asset variety and infinite scalability, providing a friendly running environment for high-throughput web3 applications.

#### Shardeum
[Shardeum](https://shardeum.org/) is an EVM-based, linearly scalable smart contract platform that provides low gas fees forever while maintaining true decentralization and solid security through dynamic state sharding.

#### Zeta
[ZetaChain](https://www.zetachain.com/) is the first ever L1 blockchain to enable fully interoperable smart contracts, including support for non-smart contract chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. And provides an unparalleled combination of security, simplicity, and flexibility for developers.

### Support EIP-4361 Sign-In with Ethereum
[Sign-In with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.

FoxWallet will parse the `Sign-In with Ethereum` message and check if `URI` and `Chain ID` matches, prevents phishing attack and keep your funds safe.

FoxWallet provides three levels of fast, medium, and slow, and allows users to customize the Gas value too.
