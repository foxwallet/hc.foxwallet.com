### Instant Swap
In this version, we have introduced built-in token swapping within the wallet. FoxWallet has partnered with the renowned swap aggregator platform [1inch](https://1inch.io) to automatically select the optimal swapping path for users, ensuring the lowest fees and the best exchange rates. It supports numerous networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis, Arbitrum, Klaytn, zkSync, BNB, Optimism, Avalanche, and more. Come and experience it now!

### New Networks

#### Manta Testnet
[Manta Network](https://manta.network/) is the multi-modular ecosystem for zero-knowledge (ZK) applications. Manta Atlantic, the fastest ZK L1 chain, brings programmable privacy to web3 through compliant on-chain privacy and identity. Manta Pacific, the unique L2 ecosystem for EVM-native ZK applications, provides a scalable and inexpensive gas-fee environment for ZK applications to deploy simply using Solidity. Together, Manta Atlantic and Manta Pacific deliver an unparalleled experience for the next generation of web3 application development and adoption with the applied usage of zero-knowledge cryptography.  

You can find `Manta Testnet` in "Me" -> "Networks" -> "Testnets" and select to enable it.

#### Public Goods Network - PGN
[The Public Goods Network (PGN)](https://publicgoods.network/) is a new L2 specifically designed to support public goods. It has the same fast, cost-efficient, and scalable features that come with an L2, but with the added benefit of collecting funding for your favorite public goods projects.  

[Public Goods Network](https://publicgoods.network/) is the only L2 network in which the vast majority of net sequencer fees go to projects that are building and/or funding public goods.  
 
You can find `PGN` in "Me" -> "Networks" and select to enable it.
