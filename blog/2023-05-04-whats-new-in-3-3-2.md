```

The [Sui](https://sui.io/) mainnet went live on May 3rd. The Sui blockchain is a Move-based, layer-1 blockchain platform developed by former Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers who worked on the now-defunct Novi project.

You can find `Sui` under "Me" -> "Networks" and select to enable it. 

### Support BTCDOMAIN's .btc Names
[BTCDOMAIN](https://www.btcdomains.io/) is a bitcoin native domain system empowered by [Ordinals](https://ordinals.com/) and ZK-STARK.

It is designed to provide an experience similar to Ethereum Name Service (ENS) by offering a wide range of name-related services, including name registration, name resolution, and other related services.

By using BTC Domain's name service, users can easily manage and update their Bitcoin addresses without having to change their associated name.
