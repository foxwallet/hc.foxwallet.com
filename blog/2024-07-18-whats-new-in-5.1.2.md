### Integrated Aleo Testnet Beta
The Aleo Testnet 3 has been officially deprecated, and the new public development environment, Testnet Beta, is now live. This environment, being closer to the mainnet, allows us to test our acceptance criteria in a more realistic setting.   

Aleo is the first innovative blockchain to solve privacy issues using zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining programmability. Both the FoxWallet browser plugin and mobile app now fully support the latest Aleo Beta Testnet, and we warmly invite you to experience it, with more exciting activities to come.

### Integrated Ton Network
TON (The Open Network) is a blockchain platform created by the widely loved instant messaging app, Telegram. The platform was designed to provide Telegram's over 500 million users with fast, secure decentralized financial services and digital identity, among others.   

Proposed first in 2018, TON aims to handle millions of transactions per second in scalability and support a decentralized application ecosystem. Despite early legal and regulatory challenges, the project successfully gained significant attention within the blockchain community, continued to evolve, and was officially launched in 2021.   

TON aspires to enable mass adoption through its high-performance and innovative technological solutions, including smart contracts and a multi-chain architecture.

### Integrated 5ire Mainnet
5ireChain is an EVM-compatible, sustainability-oriented smart contract platform that focuses on developing a sustainable and beneficial ecosystem based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our goal is to build a computing platform that promotes and advocates these activities to achieve the goals.

### Supported Coreum Staking
Coreum is a public Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, meaning that the weight of validators is determined by the amount of staking tokens (COREUM) bonded as collateral. These COREUM tokens can be self-delegated directly by the validator or delegated to the validator by other COREUM holders. 

### Bug fixes and experience improvements
- Added search function and widgets to the home page.
- Added airdrop information to the discovery page.
- Support for adding tokens on the Cosmos chain via contract addresses.
- Push notifications are now displayed even when the app is in the foreground.
- Upgraded the Sumsub SDK.
- WalletConnect pop-ups now display network information.
- Optimized fee retrieval for Bitcoin testnet and Qtum.
- Fixed Qtum DApp connection issues.
