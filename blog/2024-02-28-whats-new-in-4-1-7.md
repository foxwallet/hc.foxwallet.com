### New Networks

#### Merlin Chain
We're introducing the [Merlin Chain](https://merlinchain.io/), a native Bitcoin Layer2 solution designed to unlock Bitcoin's full potential. By leveraging native Layer1 assets, users, and protocols, Merlin Chain brings innovation and utility to Layer2. Features include low fees, high scalability, EVM compatibility for swift transactions, and support for popular Bitcoin protocols (BRC20, BRC420, Bitmap, Atomicals, Pipe, Stamp, etc.). With ZK-Rollup technology, Merlin Chain enhances efficiency and scalability, ensuring transparent and secure transactions through decentralized Oracles.

#### Dymension
Welcome to [Dymension](https://dymension.xyz/), a network featuring fast, modular blockchains known as RollApps. Dymension functions as a full-stack web application's back-end, coordinating the ecosystem and communicating with RollApps, similar to a server in traditional web setups. This network facilitates seamless interactions through RollApps for games, DeFi, NFT projects, and more, backed by decentralized data availability networks (DANs) for secure and efficient data publicizing.

#### X1 Testnet
Introducing the [X1](https://www.okx.com/x1), a ZK-powered Layer-2 network bridging the OKX and Ethereum communities, promoting a globally accessible on-chain ecosystem. X1 uses OKB as its native token, ensuring smooth asset transfers between OKX exchange and X1. The network offers instant finality, unified liquidity, and independent data availability on its zkEVM layer-2 platform. Ahead of the mainnet launch, we're inviting users to the X1 Tour, a series of weekly challenges offering a unique interaction experience within the X1 ecosystem, with opportunities to earn exclusive X1 NFTs.

#### Plume Testnet
[Plume](https://www.plumenetwork.xyz/) is the first modular L2 blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), integrating asset tokenization and compliance directly into the chain. Our goal is to streamline RWA project deployment and offer a blockchain ecosystem for cross-investment in various RWAs. Plume enhances RWA composability through its DeFi applications, increasing liquidity and access to high-quality buyers for tokenized RWAs.

Script TV employs an upgradeable NFT mechanism to enhance user earnings and engagement. With a dual token economy (SCPT for governance and SPAY for transactions and rewards), Script TV offers a dynamic user experience with round-the-clock content and in-app gamification.
