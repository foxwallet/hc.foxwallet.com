**Time: Aug 14 — Aug 21**

### How to earn Fox Credits?

1. Daily Check-in: create/import the wallet and go check-in, you’ll get 20 credits on a daily basis; the initial check-in will be counted for 40 credits; 40 extra credits will be rewarded to those who check in 7 consecutive days during the campaign. Your total credits by check-in will be 200 in total.
2. Invite Friends: each invite can get you 100 credits and each invitee will receive 50 credits — — more invites, more credits.
3. Finish Zealy Tasks: each XP you get on Zealy equals 1 Credit in the FoxWallet app. These credits will be updated by the end of the campaign.

Zealy tasks include:
- [Follow Twitter, like, retweet the event tweet](https://twitter.com/FoxWallet)
- Tweet about us: including the words “Fox Credits”
- [Join Telegram](https://t.me/FoxWallet_EN)
- [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/foxwallet)
- Finish FoxWallet Daily Task
- Invite friends

### How to share the rewards?
All participants share the reward pools proportionally to the credits earned.

For example, Alice earned 500 Fox Credits and the total Credits for the first Pool was 100,000, then Alice would get (500/100,000)*200U = 1U.

|  Fox Credits | Prize Pool |
|  ------- | ----------- |
| 0 ~ 800 | 200 USDT |
| 800 ~ 1300 | 300 USDT |
| > 1300 | 500 USDT |

- **Rewards under 0.05U will not be distributed. All USDT will be sent on the Polygon network.**
- The FoxWallet Credits Launching Campaign prize pool is reserved for Fox Credits earned during the campaign only. Credits earned before or after the campaign are not counted.
- FoxWallet reserves the final right of interpretation.
