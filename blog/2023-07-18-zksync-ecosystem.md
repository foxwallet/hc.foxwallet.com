## Today we'll talk about zkSync Era Ecosystem - 54 popular projects
As a disruptive innovation, blockchain technology has attracted the attention and participation of numerous projects and developers. Among them, zkSync, as a layer 2 scaling solution, has gained significant attention due to its utilization of the latest generation of succinct zero-knowledge proof technology, which preserves the security attributes of the underlying blockchain.  
By executing computations and storage off-chain, zkSync transfers all funds to be held by smart contracts on the main chain, thereby achieving efficient transaction processing and scalability.   
This article will introduce 54 popular projects within the zkSync ecosystem, showcasing the diverse applications and vast prospects of this technology.
