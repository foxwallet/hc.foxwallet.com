### Aleo Staking
We are excited to announce that FoxWallet now officially supports Aleo POS staking mining. This service is provided by our partner [Beta Staking](https://betastaking.com/), with no minimum staking amount required, allowing you to redeem at any time. It's secure and reliable, and the staking token stALEO can be freely transferred.
