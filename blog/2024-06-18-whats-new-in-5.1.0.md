### Multi-chain Asset Aggregation
The long-awaited multichain assets summary mode is finally here. You can now view the assets of all added chains on a single page. Upgrade and experience it now!

### DApp Browser Supports Connecting to Multiple Networks Simultaneously
FoxWallet is the first and only wallet on the market that supports connecting to multiple networks simultaneously on mobile devices. This feature allows DApps to simultaneously access users' addresses across multiple networks, which is particularly convenient in cross-chain scenarios.

### Qtum Offline Delegate Staking
Qtum offline staking allows all holders to delegate their non-staking wallet addresses to superstakers without relinquishing control over their tokens and privileges. Thus, users with limited time or resources for online staking can still participate in network consensus.  


- Go to "Wallet" -> [Switch network](https://hc.foxwallet.com/docs/basic/manage-funds#switch-networks) to `Qtum`
- You can find "Offline Staking" in tools section

### New Networks

#### Taiko Mainnet
A highly configurable, fully open source, permissionless Ethereum-equivalent rollup. Taiko can be easily set up as a fully ZK rollup, an optimistic rollup, or anything in between. There are no centralized actors operating the network; all operations are run by the community without permission.

#### Areon Mainnet
Areon Network is a unique, decentralized layer 1 blockchain project that has maintained a spotless record of stable development from day one. Areon Network is developing the Areon Chain, where anyone can build new DApps, perform daily interactions of sending and receiving payments instantly for incredibly low fees. Our consensus mechanism is called Proof of Area, a unique technology that supports up to 600,000 TPS and completes a transaction in about 100 milliseconds.

#### Optopia Mainnet
Optopia is an AI-driven, intent-centric Layer 2 network that allows permissionless intent creation. It leverages tokenomics to drive AI Agents to perform intents, thereby creating a smarter and actively engaged Layer 2 with outstanding Daily Active AIs. Optopia's mission is to simplify Web3 operations through AI Agents, helping more users enter the Web3 industry with minimal barriers and empowering AI Agents through tokenomics to unleash the true potential of Web3.

#### 5ire Testnet
5ireChain is an EVM-compatible, sustainability-oriented smart contract platform that focuses on developing a sustainable and beneficial ecosystem based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our goal is to build a computing platform that promotes and advocates these activities to achieve the goals.
