# What is Nibiru
[Nibiru Chain](https://nibiru.fi/) is a breakthrough L1 blockchain and smart contract ecosystem providing superior throughput and unparalleled security. Nibiru aims to be the most developer-friendly and user-friendly smart contract platform in Web3.    

Nibiru Chain addresses decentralization, security, and scalability in tandem, ensuring an optimal user experience even during periods of high demand. The network's superior throughput, instant finality, and advanced parallel processing capabilities help make it an ideal platform for real-time consumer applications.  

Nibiru aims to be the most developer-friendly and user-friendly smart contract ecosystem. Since emerging from stealth, dozens of projects have begun building on Nibiru across sectors like DeFi, gaming, real-world assets (RWAs), NFTs, developer tools, and bridges.  

Smart contracts in Nibiru's primary execution engine (Wasm) are impervious to the vast majority of attack vectors on that plague the Web3 landscape, such as re-entrancy, arithmetic overflow and underflow, ERC20 short address attacks, and many others, enabling high-reliability apps to be brought to life more rapidly.
