# Coreum Staking

### What is Coreum Staking?
Coreum is a public Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, meaning that the weight of validators is determined by the amount of staking tokens (COREUM) bonded as collateral. These COREUM tokens can be self-delegated directly by the validator or delegated to the validator by other COREUM holders.  

A validator's weight (i.e. voting power), determines whether they are an active participant in the validator set. The active validator set is limited to an amount that changes over time.

### What is Validator?
The role of validators is to run a full node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by the validator's private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. Validators must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.

### How to earn rewards?
Depositors earn rewards by depositing Coreum. Please note that each staked asset requires a few days to be unstaked. Besides, when you unstake COREUM, your rewards will be sent to your account automatically.

### Data Index Explanation
- Total Value Locked: the total value of coreum (including earnings) at the previous snapshot.
- APR: the annual return rate.
- Voting Power: the weight of a validator which determines their eligibility as an active validator. 
- Commission: the fee deducted by validators from the block rewards before distribution to their delegators.
