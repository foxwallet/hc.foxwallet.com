Welcome to use FoxWallet, we have brought you a brand-new points system, Fox Credit, which aims to motivate users to use various functions of FoxWallet. At the same time, external projects can create tasks in FoxWallet for product promotion.

## 1. What is Fox Credit
The Fox Credit is a mechanism designed to reward users and encourage them to use our products more frequently, which can be used to purchase goods in the Credit mall or participate in lucky draws to win more rewards.
