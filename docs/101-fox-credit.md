Welcome to use FoxWallet! We have brought you a brand new points system designed to help you manage and fully utilize your points more easily. This manual will provide a detailed introduction to our points system and its various functions.

## 1. What is Fox Credit
The Fox Credit is a mechanism designed to reward users and encourage them to use our products more frequently. You can earn Fox Credit by completing specified tasks on the page, which can be used to purchase goods in the future Fox Credit mall or participate in lucky draws to win more rewards.

## 2. How to earn Fox Credit
### 2.1 Daily check-in
By logging into your wallet and clicking the "Check-in" button on the page every day, you will receive a certain amount of Fox Credit as a reward. Additionally, there will be extra rewards for consecutive check-ins for 7 days.

### 2.2 Completing tasks
In addition to earning Fox Credit through daily check-ins and transfers, our points system also provides various other tasks for you to accumulate Fox Credit more quickly and diversely.

1. Invite friends  
* By inviting your friends to use FoxWallet, you will receive additional Fox Credit as a reward. Simply use the invitation link or code in the application to invite your friends to install FoxWallet, and both you and your friends will receive Fox Credit rewards.  
* Please note that the number of invites made before FoxCredit went live will not be counted towards rewards.

2. More types of tasks coming soon

## 3. Uses of Fox Credit
We provide you with a Fox Credit mall and a lucky draw system, where you can use Fox Credit to redeem goods or participate in lucky draw activities.
The Fox Credit mall and lucky draw feature are currently under development, please stay tuned.
