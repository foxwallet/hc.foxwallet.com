# HashKey Cloud Pooled Staking

FoxWallet's built-in ETH staking service is powered by [HashKey Cloud](https://www.hashkey.cloud/).

### What is HashKey Cloud Pooled Staking?
HashKey Cloud pooled staking is a small funds custody scheme where funds are held in the contract. All information is publicly transparent and verifiable. 

### What is Point?
HashKey Cloud uses "Point" to replace "Liquidity", following a logic similar to "Liquid Staking". Point is HashKey Cloud's liquid staking token.

### How to earn rewards?
Depositors earn rewards by depositing Ethereum and holding the Point token. Please note that each staked asset requires seven days to be unstaked.

### Data Index Explanation
