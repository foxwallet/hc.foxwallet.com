# Transfer Between 0x and f1

FoxWallet is a decentralized, multi-chain wallet with full support for Filecoin. It integrates with the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM), allowing users to easily transfer FIL to and from `f4` address without manual setup. This guide explains how to transfer FIL using FoxWallet.

FoxWallet uses Filecoin's built-in [FilFowarder](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/wallets/filforwader/), a smart contract that lets users transfer FIL from an Ethereum-based `f4` address to a Filecoin address of a different type.  To use FoxWallet, you must set up and configure FoxWallet before beginning the transfer process, described below.

## Setup and configuration
1. [Download FoxWallet](https://foxwallet.com/download).
2. Open the FoxWallet application.
3. For the purpose of this tutorial, select **Create wallet** to create a new wallet. Alternatively, select **Import wallet** to import an existing wallet.
4. **Set password**.
5. **Backup seed phrase**, note the terms and the order in which they appear.
6. Click "Receive" and select network, you can find `Filecoin` and `Filecoin EVM` out there. The `Filecoin` network uses the `f1` address, while `Filecoin EVM` uses the Ethereum-style `0x` address.

## Transfer 
1. Go to the "Wallet" page. Choose `Filecoin` network.
2. Click "Receive" to get your `f1` address. FIL can be transferred to this address via exchange withdrawals, or other tools that support `f1` address. 
3. Switch to the `Filecoin EVM` network. Click "Receive" to get your Ethereum-style `0x` address, copy it.
4. Back to the `Filecoin` network in FoxWallet. Click "Send" and paste your Ethereum-style `0x` address in the blank.
5. Input the amount of FIL youâ€™d like to transfer and then click "Confirm", check out your account later.
6. Reverse the steps 2,3,4 if you would like to transfer FIL from `0x(f4)` to `f1`. 

### In fact, you can transfer with any type of address in FoxWallet directly
* from `f1` to `f0`
* from `f1` to `f1`
* from `f1` to `f3`
