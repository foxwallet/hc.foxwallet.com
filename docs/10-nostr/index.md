[Nostr](https://nostr.com/) is now supported by FoxWallet, providing a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media. Each Nostr account is based on a public/private key pair.   

Your public key serves as your username, while your private key functions as your password; however, it cannot be reset if lost.  

It's imperative to store your private key securely, such as in a password manager.   

With our integration of Nostr, users can now utilize its decentralized social media capabilities seamlessly within our software.

Go to "Me" -> "Networks" -> find and enable `Nostr`.

**FoxWallet is the best Nostr wallet.**

## Usage
* Open [FoxWallet](https://foxwallet.com/download)
* Create or Import wallet
* Go to "Me" => "Networks"
