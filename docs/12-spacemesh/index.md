[Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/) is a unique protocol using a race-free, mesh-based system for block production. Miners, called smeshers, submit proof of space time through activation transactions to become eligible to create blocks. The protocol employs a consensus mechanism called "Tortoise beacon" to determine when and how blocks are produced, ensuring fairness and security within the network. This design enables a fair distribution of block creation among smeshers and facilitates secure validation for new participants joining the network.  

**FoxWallet is the best Spacemesh wallet.**
