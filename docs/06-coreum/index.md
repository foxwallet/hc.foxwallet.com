# What is Coreum
[Coreum](https://www.coreum.com/) is a third-generation, enterprise-grade Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as core infrastructure for decentralized applications, featuring ISO20022 compatibility, IBC interoperability, and innovative Smart Tokens.   

The network ensures high throughput, cost-effective fees, and unmatched scalability. WASM-based smart contracts enable diverse use cases, while the low-latency, PoS network drives rapid, secure, and modular applications, accelerating decentralized tech adoption in large-scale organizations.   

Coreum is fast, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly due to its Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) consensus mechanism, avoiding the high energy costs of other blockchains, while its scalability and throughput ensure that network operations do not incur exorbitant fees.
