# zkSync 1.0 Tutorial

zkSync is a trustless protocol for scalable low-cost payments on Ethereum, powered by [zkRollup technology](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/tech.html#zk-rollup-architecture), from [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/). It uses zero-knowledge proofs and on-chain data availability to keep users' funds as safe as though they never left the mainnet.

**Some of the main features of zkSync are:**
* Extremely low transaction fees
* Trustless protocol
* Funds are cryptographically secure, as in the Ethereum mainnet
* Users are always in control of their funds
* No requirement for operational activity to keep the funds safe

zkSync 1.0 lives on Ethereum mainnet already.

Open FoxWallet, [switch network](../manage-funds.md) to "Ethereum mainnet", go to "Discover" tab and input url https://zksync.io/ or just search zksync to visit.
