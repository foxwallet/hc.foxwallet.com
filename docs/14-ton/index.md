[TON](https://ton.org/) (The Open Network) is a blockchain platform created by the widely loved instant messaging app, Telegram. The platform was designed to provide Telegram's over 500 million users with fast, secure decentralized financial services and digital identity, among others.   

Proposed first in 2018, TON aims to handle millions of transactions per second in scalability and support a decentralized application ecosystem. Despite early legal and regulatory challenges, the project successfully gained significant attention within the blockchain community, continued to evolve, and was officially launched in 2021.   

TON aspires to enable mass adoption through its high-performance and innovative technological solutions, including smart contracts and a multi-chain architecture.
